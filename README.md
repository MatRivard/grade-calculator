# GradeCalculator

Project can be found at [https://MatRivard.github.io/grade-calculator](https://MatRivard.github.io/grade-calculator).

A grade calculator helping students determine what they need to get on their final exam to finish with their desired grade. Calculated using the weighted average of term tests, laboratories, etc. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.2.

Progress can be saved to local storage in order to revisit the calculations at a later time. No account creation for permanent saving functionality currently implemented however. That said, saved courses will disappear when local storage is cleared.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
